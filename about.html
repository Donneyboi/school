			<p>Perhaps, one of the things we value most at HFS, is family. We believe that family is everything! As a school, we work to strengthen the bond between parents and their children. How, you may ask.

HFS strives to make parents an integral part of the children’s daily learning experiences. You find parents taking part in school functions like Field Trips, Cookery classes, Academic competitions, Character Counts programmes, and a lot others.

At HFS, we value our staff. We train them to add value to the lives of the children they care for. We believe that our staff are equipped to provide the best support for the pupils academically, emotionally and socially, with an eye towards opening the doors to a friendly world, a world of possibilities.

Here, we value our pupils. We encourage them to be themselves. We care for children with all kinds of temperaments and peculiarities. We believe that every child is special. Every child is intelligent. All a child needs, is an opportunity to discover himself. At HFS, we give every child the chance to view the world through his own eyes, and to discover a whole new world.

We value relationships. Through social events, we connect families, and encourage them to take their relations beyond school functions like Saturday exercises, PTA End of Year parties, and PTA meetings. Through HFS, families have bonded and remained friends long after their children graduate or they relocate to other parts of the world.

We value 
They learn self expression and passionate involvement in any pursuit.

We would like to meet you. Why not visit our lovely school and experience the delightful and constant bustle of activity that goes on here. We will be waiting to receive you!</p>
